# bin

Basically this is a super-WIP "replacement" for Google Drive. I'd appreciate a better name. I'm making this because I keep trying to use Vim shortcuts in google drive and it is not very great.

## Goals

[ ] Vim shortcuts in the editor
[ ] Customizable editor (probably goona use Ace for this)
[ ] Render Markdown or even LaTeX
[ ] Move files to a database
[ ] File encryption
[ ] Integrate with Google Drive

## How to use

1. `go get github.com/vityavv/bin`
2. `bin` (I know this is probably a bad name for some)
3. go to `localhost:8080` in your browser
4. Create yourself an account, log in, etc. (I'm trying to make it pretty straightfoward)
